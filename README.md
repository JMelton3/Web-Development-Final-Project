"# Web-Development-Final-Project" 

  This was my final project for my web development class. I used open weather api to check the weather for each of the races for the 2022 season and made a stats page for Max Verstappen. I also used MySQL to create a database for taking in data from the user as well as displaying data for the database.
  
  Languages used for this project:
    Html
    Css
    PHP
    MySQL
    Bootstrap
    Javascript
    Jquery
